The project focused on analyzing car listings from AutoScout24, a prominent German car marketplace, to derive meaningful insights that could inform both buyers and sellers. 
The dataset was thoroughly processed, filtering out irrelevant or inconsistent data, and focusing on key attributes like brand, fuel type, price, mileage, and power.

The analysis revealed distinct trends in the automotive market. For instance, the distribution of car listings across different brands highlighted the most popular manufacturers. 
By calculating average prices and fuel consumption, the project shed light on the cost-efficiency of different brands and fuel types. 
The project also explored the efficiency of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by examining average fuel consumption per brand, providing insights into which manufacturers offer the most fuel-efficient 
options.

Visualizations played a crucial role, with bar plots illustrating key findings such as the number of listings per brand, average price per brand, and fuel efficiency by fuel type. 
These visualizations helped in quickly identifying patterns and outliers.

In conclusion, this project offered a comprehensive overview of the German automotive market, providing actionable insights for buyers, sellers, and industry professionals looking to understand market trends and 
consumer preferences in a data-driven manner.
